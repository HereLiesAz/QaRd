# Release Notes: QaRd Widget v1.0.0

**Release Date:** 2025-08-11

## Summary

This is the initial release of the QaRd Widget, a simple and customizable widget for displaying QR
codes on your Android home screen and lock screen.

## What's New

*   **QR Code Generation:** Easily create a QR code from any text you provide. This is perfect for sharing URLs, contact information, Wi-Fi details, or any other text-based data.
*   **Customizable Appearance:**
    *   **Shape:** Choose between a classic square or a modern circular QR code.
    *   **Colors:** Personalize the foreground and background colors of the QR code to match your device's theme or wallpaper.
*   **Home Screen and Lock Screen Support:**
    *   Place the widget on your home screen for quick access.
    *   On supported devices, like the Google Pixel Tablet, you can also add the widget to your lock screen.
*   **Multiple Widgets:** Add as many QR code widgets as you need, each with its own unique data and appearance.

## Known Issues

*   **Lock Screen Availability:** The ability to place widgets on the lock screen is currently limited by the Android operating system. As of now, this feature is primarily available on devices like the Google Pixel Tablet. For other devices, the widget works perfectly on the home screen.
*   **Reconfiguration:** To change an existing widget's data or appearance, you currently need to remove it and add it again. An in-place reconfiguration feature is planned for a future release.
