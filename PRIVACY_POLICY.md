# Privacy Policy for QR Lockscreen Widget

**Last Updated: 2025-08-11**

Thank you for choosing QR Lockscreen Widget. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you about how we handle information when you use our application.

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

We want to be crystal clear: **QR Lockscreen Widget does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from your device.**

The application is designed to be a simple, offline utility. All the data you provide for generating a QR code is stored locally on your device and is never sent to us or any third party.

Specifically, we do not collect:
-   Personal identification information (such as your name, email address, or phone number).
-   Device information (such as your device ID, IP address, or location).
-   Usage data (such as how you interact with the app).
-   Any data you enter into the widget's configuration.

## 2. How Your Data Is Used

The only data the app handles is the text you provide to generate the QR code. This data is:
-   **Stored Locally:** The configuration for your widget, including the QR code data, is saved only on your device's local storage.
-   **Used for QR Code Generation:** The app uses this data solely to generate the QR code image that is displayed in the widget.
-   **Never Transmitted:** This data is never sent off your device.

## 3. Permissions

QR Lockscreen Widget does not request any special permissions that would allow it to access your personal information. The app only uses the standard permissions required to function as a home screen widget.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy in the future if we add new features that change how data is handled. If we do, we will notify you by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
